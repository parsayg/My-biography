            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
                I’m a 16-year-old from Iran with a passion for turning ideas into reality through creativity and code.
This summer has been a turning point for me — I’ve changed a lot, both in mindset and in skills.
I discovered programming not just as a skill, but as something that deeply fits my personality, and I’ve fallen in love with it.
In just one month, I’ve made significant progress in coding, building real projects and improving every single day.
Beyond tech, I’m also working hard on my English, currently preparing for the TOEFL to open global opportunities.
I dream of becoming financially successful, achieving my biggest goals, and living the life I’ve always imagined for myself.
I want to travel the world, experience different cultures, and build a lifestyle full of freedom and creativity.
Creativity drives me — I have a natural talent for design and dream of becoming a professional game designer.
I’m committed, ambitious, and ready to work relentlessly to turn these dreams into reality
